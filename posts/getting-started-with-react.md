React is a **JavaScript library for building user interfaces**.

Wait a second ... a "library" for JavaScript? Isn't JavaScript powerful enough on its own?

Well ... first of all, React focuses on building UI components in a more efficient and manageable way. That seems to be important for some people.

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already provides a structured way to create UI components, thus serving as an additional layer on top of JavaScript.

## Why would we then choose React?

Because React simplifies the process of building complex user interfaces - especially for single-page applications (though it does way more than just that).

In this guide, we'll explore some of the key concepts and features that React offers:

- Component-Based Architecture
- Virtual DOM for Efficient Rendering
- JSX Syntax for Declarative UI
- State Management with Hooks
- Much More

## Component-Based Architecture
